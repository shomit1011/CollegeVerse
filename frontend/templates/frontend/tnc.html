            <dd>
            <p>It may happen that our platform is down, either for planned maintenance or because something goes down with the site. It may happen that one of our instructors is making misleading statements in their content. It may also happen that we encounter security issues. These are just examples. You accept that you will not have any recourse against us in any of these types of cases where things don’t work out right. In legal, more complete language,<b> the Services and their content are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. We (and our affiliates, suppliers, partners, and agents) make no representations or warranties about the suitability, reliability, availability, timeliness, security, lack of errors, or accuracy of the Services or their content, and expressly disclaim any warranties or conditions (express or implied), including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. We (and our affiliates, suppliers, partners, and agents) make no warranty that you will obtain specific results from use of the Services. Your use of the Services (including any content) is entirely at your own risk. Some jurisdictions don’t allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so some of the above exclusions may not apply to you.</b></p>
            <p>We may decide to cease making available certain features of the Services at any time and for any reason. Under no circumstances will CollegeVerse or its affiliates, suppliers, partners or agents be held liable for any damages due to such interruptions or lack of availability of such features.</p>
            <p>We are not responsible for delay or failure of our performance of any of the Services caused by events beyond our reasonable control, like an act of war, hostility, or sabotage; natural disaster; electrical, internet, or telecommunication outage; or government restrictions.</p>
        </dd>
            <p> </p>
            <li> Limitation of Liability</li><p> </p>
            <dd>
            <p>We (and our group companies, suppliers, partners, and agents) will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages (including loss of data, revenue, profits, or business opportunities, or personal injury or death), whether arising in contract, warranty, tort, product liability, or otherwise, and even if we’ve been advised of the possibility of damages in advance. </p>
        </dd>
        <li> Dispute Resolution</li><p> </p>
        <dd>
            <p>If there’s a dispute, our Support Team is happy to help resolve the issue. If that doesn’t work and you live in India, your options are to go to small claims court or bring a claim in binding arbitration; you may not bring that claim in another court or participate in a non-individual class action claim against us.</p>
            <p>This Dispute Resolution section applies only if you live in India. Most disputes can be resolved, so before bringing a formal legal case, please first try contacting our Support Team.</p>
            <ol type="a">
            <li>Small Claims</li>
            <dd>Either of us can bring a claim in a small claims court in (a) Patna , (b) another place we both agree on, as long as it qualifies to be brought in that court.</dd>
            <li>Going to Arbitration</li>
            <dd>If we can’t resolve our dispute amicably, you and CollegeVerse agree to resolve any claims related to these Terms (or our other legal terms) through final and binding arbitration, regardless of the type of claim or legal theory. If one of us brings a claim in court that should be arbitrated and the other party refuses to arbitrate it, the other party can ask a court to force us both to go to arbitration (compel arbitration). Either of us can also ask a court to halt a court proceeding while an arbitration proceeding is ongoing.</dd>
            <li>The Arbitration Process</li>
            <dd>Any disputes that involve a claim of less than Rs.1,00,000 Rupees must be resolved exclusively through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. A party electing arbitration must initiate proceedings by filing an arbitration demand with the Indian Council of Arbitration (ICA). The arbitration proceedings shall be governed by the ICA Commercial Arbitration Rules, Consumer Due Process Protocol, and Supplementary Procedures for Resolution of Consumer-Related Disputes. You and we agree that the following rules will apply to the proceedings: (a) the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online, or based solely on written submissions (at the choice of the party seeking relief); (b) the arbitration must not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses (unless we and you agree otherwise); and (c) any judgment on the arbitrator’s rendered award may be entered in any court with competent jurisdiction. Disputes that involve a claim of more than Rs.1,00,000 Rupees must be resolved per the ICA’s rules about whether the arbitration hearing has to be in-person.</dd>
            <li>No Class Actions</li>
            <dd>We both agree that we can each only bring claims against the other on an individual basis. This means: (a) neither of us can bring a claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class action, consolidated action, or representative action; (b) an arbitrator can’t combine multiple people’s claims into a single case (or preside over any consolidated, class, or representative action); and (c) an arbitrator’s decision or award in one person’s case can only impact that user, not other users, and can’t be used to decide other users’ disputes. If a court decides that this “No class actions” clause isn’t enforceable or valid, then this “Dispute Resolution” section will be null and void, but the rest of the Terms will still apply.</dd>
            <li>Changes</li>
            <dd>Notwithstanding the “Updating these Terms” section below, if CollegeVerse changes this "Dispute Resolution" section after the date you last indicated acceptance to these Terms, you may reject any such change by providing CollegeVerse written notice of such rejection by mail to by email from the email address associated with your Account to notices@CollegeVerse.com, within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated by the "last updated on" language above. To be effective, the notice must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to reject changes to this "Dispute Resolution" section. By rejecting changes, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between you and CollegeVerse in accordance with the provisions of this "Dispute Resolution" section as of the date you last indicated acceptance to these Terms.</dd>

        </dd>
            <p> </p>
            <li> Updating These Terms</li><p> </p>
            <dd>
            <p>From time to time, we may update these Terms to clarify our practices or to reflect new or different practices (such as when we add new features), and CollegeVerse reserves the right in its sole discretion to modify and/or make changes to these Terms at any time. If we make any material change, we will notify you using prominent means, such as by email notice sent to the email address specified in your account or by posting a notice through our Services. Modifications will become effective on the day they are posted unless stated otherwise.</p>
            <p>Your continued use of our Services after changes become effective shall mean that you accept those changes. Any revised Terms shall supersede all previous Terms.</p>
